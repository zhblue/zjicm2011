<h1>Grade</h1>
<p>The max grade for the testcase.</p>
<p>If the assignment's max grade is set to 50, and this testcase's grade is set to 20%, then students who pass the test will earn 10 points and who can not pass will get zero. The final grade is the sum of all testcases' grades. If the sum is larger than the assignment's max grade, the max grade will be used as the final grade.</p>
<p>The sum of all testcases' max grades is not required to be 100%. Therefore, you can leave some points for manual grading if the sum is below 100%. And you can also make the sum be above 100% so that not all testcases are required to pass.</p>
