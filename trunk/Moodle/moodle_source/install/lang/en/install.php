<p>We recommend that you configure PHP with a higher limit if possible, like 40M.  
   There are several ways of doing this that you can try:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are able to, recompile PHP with <i>--enable-memory-limit</i>.  
    This will allow Moodle to set the memory limit itself.</li>
<li>If you have access to your php.ini file, you can change the <b>memory_limit</b> 
    setting in there to something like 40M.  If you don\'t have access you might 
    be able to ask your administrator to do this for you.</li>
<li>On some PHP servers you can create a .htaccess file in the Moodle directory 
    containing this line:
    <blockquote><div>php_value memory_limit 40M</div></blockquote>
    <p>However, on some servers this will prevent <b>all</b> PHP pages from working 
    (you will see errors when you look at pages) so you\'ll have to remove the .htaccess file.</p></li>
